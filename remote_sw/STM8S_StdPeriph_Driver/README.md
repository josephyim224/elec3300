# STM8S for SDCC

This is a slightly modified version of the [STM8S/A Standard
peripheral library](http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stsw-stm8069.html) that supports the [SDCC compiler](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/).

The code from ST doesn't support SDCC out of the box, and on Linux there don't appear to be any other supported compiler options for the STM8 architecture.

## Usage

Include `inc/stm8s.h`. This contains all of the preprocessor logic for different device types and includes other driver headers as needed.

Add a define to your compiler flags to select your device:

| Device def | Family name |
|------------|-------------|
| `STM8S208` | STM8S High density devices with CAN |
| `STM8S207` | STM8S High density devices without CAN |
| `STM8S007` | STM8S Value Line High density devices |
| `STM8AF52Ax` | STM8A High density devices with CAN |
| `STM8AF62Ax` | STM8A High density devices without CAN |
| `STM8S105` | STM8S Medium density devices |
| `STM8S005` | STM8S Value Line Medium density devices |
| `STM8AF626x` | STM8A Medium density devices |
| `STM8AF622x` | STM8A Low density devices |
| `STM8S103` | STM8S Low density devices |
| `STM8S003` | STM8S Value Line Low density devices |
| `STM8S903` | STM8S Low density devices |

### Register-only mode

Define `NO_STDPERIPH_DRIVER` if you only care about using the registers defined in this library and none of the C functions.

Note that this causes enums from peripheral headers to also be excluded currently (eg. `TIM4_PRESCALER_256`).
